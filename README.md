## Mapping_Earthquakes
// Purpose show the difference between the magnitude of earthquakes around the world last seven days
// Will use URL for GeoJson earthquake data from USGS website (coordinates)
// Will use JavaScript and D3.js library (coordinates)
// Will use Leaflet library to plot data on a Mapbox map through API request

// Step 1: create Mapbox account for access token to create own API key
// Get organized - setup and add folders and files - create branch off GitHub (create sandbox)

## In Conclusion
Once I was able to get the tectonic plate to show, the rest of the challenge went smooth. Moved the legend from bottom right to top right. Great exercise
